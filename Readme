This document outlines the ongoing work in developing agents that utilize Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance their capabilities. The integration of LLMs into agent-based systems represents a significant advancement in artificial intelligence, allowing for more dynamic, autonomous, and context-aware interactions across various applications.
Overview of LLM Agents
LLM agents operate on the foundation of large language models, which are advanced AI systems capable of understanding and generating human-like text. These agents are designed to perform a range of tasks autonomously, including:
